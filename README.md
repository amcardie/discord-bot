# discord-bot
A learning experience with discord.py

It's not going to be a very specialized bot more or less just a general bot for fun

So far:
Added some fun/general commands
Added 1 moderation command
Learned and added message deletion logging

TODO:
More moderation commands
Logging message edits

Thoughts on new commands:
Moving some game like commands from general cog to a seperate cog
Adding a tik-tac-toe like game to the cog mentioned above
